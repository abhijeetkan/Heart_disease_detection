A publicly available dataset from kaggle has been used to make this Heart Disease Prediction model.
Here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
Libraries used: numpy, pandas, sklearn.

This data set uses the following attributes:
age, sex,chest pain type (4 values), resting blood pressure, serum cholestoral in mg/dl, fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2), maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy, thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect.

sklearn library has been used to predict and train the model using logistic regression algorithm.
Logistic regression, or Sigmoid funciton has been used which takes independent variables and produces probability between 0 to 1. 0 being healthy and 1 being defective.
The accuracy of model on training data is 0.83.

The code has been explained using comments in the main file itself.
